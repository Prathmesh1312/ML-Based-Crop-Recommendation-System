# CropSense: Smart Agricultural Advisory System

CropSense is an intelligent agricultural advisory system designed to assist farmers and agricultural enthusiasts in optimizing crop health and soil management. This project leverages real-time field data, including key soil parameters such as **Nitrogen (N)**, **Phosphorus (P)**, **Potassium (K)**, and **Soil Moisture**, to classify soil quality and assess erosion risk. The application provides **actionable recommendations** to improve soil quality and mitigate risks, enhancing sustainable farming practices.

The system is built using **Flask** for the backend and features an **interactive frontend** for data input, allowing users to analyze multiple soil samples. It incorporates modern web design principles, ensures seamless interaction, and integrates API features to fetch data about **nearby markets** or **farming resources**. CropSense is a step toward smarter farming through data-driven decision-making.
